### Mini installed + initial design language elicited
**Date:** 2026-04-21
**Branch:** mini-install
**Commit:** pending

**What was done:**
Installed Mini design system at `packages/ui/` via Mini's `install.sh`. Installed 6 design-system skills at `.claude/skills/` (`elicit-design-language`, `generate-ui`, `check-component-reuse`, `enforce-tokens`, `audit-a11y`, `propagate-language-update`), the invariant runner at `tools/invariants/`, and Mini templates at `templates/`. Ran greenfield elicitation against the prior `design-language.draft.md`; produced the final `core-docs/design-language.md` with all 10 axioms set and the draft's Core Principles / Depth Model / Review Checklist carried through. Seeded `core-docs/component-manifest.json`, `core-docs/pattern-log.md`, and `core-docs/generation-log.md`. Appended a marker-delimited Mini section to `CLAUDE.md` and extended the Core Documents table to list the new docs. Updated `packages/ui/styles/tokens.css` to reflect elicited values: fonts Geist + Geist Mono, radii 3/6/10/14, gray→mauve alias, accent→gray monochrome binding (dropped indigo + crimson imports). Synced Mini pin to `83df0b2` (latest; adds worktree-safe install check).

**Why:**
Designer's design-language scaffolding needed to become real before any surface ships. Mini is the intended substrate; installing it now — before Phase 8 frontend wiring — means the tokens, axioms, skills, and invariants are ready and the design decisions are made when real UI work starts. Elicitation converts the draft's prose principles into Mini's axiom → token cascade.

**Design decisions:**
- **Monochrome accent (axiom #3).** Notion/Linear-style greyscale, rejected chromatic accent candidates (purple overlaps Linear; terracotta/red overlap Claude brand or read too hot). Semantic colors (success/warning/danger/info) stay chromatic because they're doing signal work, not decoration. Enforced in code: `--accent-*` binds to `--gray-*`; no Radix chromatic import.
- **Mauve gray flavor (axiom #4).** Warmer than pure gray, still feels professional. Olive and sand are explicit alternatives to A/B once real surfaces exist. Swap mechanism documented in `pattern-log.md`.
- **Geist + Geist Mono (axiom #6).** Starting choice, font wiring deferred to Phase 8. System fallbacks in the stack mean nothing breaks if Geist isn't loaded.
- **Motion principle amended.** Draft said "motion is functional, not decorative." User amended during elicitation: snappy remains the personality, but considered liveliness is welcome — "it's a design tool and should feel nice." No gratuitous motion.
- **Theme principle amended.** Draft said "dark-default, light-parity required." User amended: system-default (`prefers-color-scheme`), both first-class, parity required.
- **Surface hierarchy = 3 tiers.** Navigation / Content / Float map directly to Mini's flat / raised / overlay. Modals borrow the overlay tier until a reason to distinguish appears.

**Technical decisions:**
- **Mini installed at `packages/ui/`.** Standard Mini layout. Fork-and-own tokens in `tokens.css` and `archetypes.css`; everything else tracks upstream via `./scripts/sync-mini.sh`.
- **Frontend wiring deferred.** No Radix npm install, no CSS import wiring, no `@mini/*` TS path alias. That's Phase 8 work per roadmap. Today's work is design data, not build plumbing.
- **Accent rebinding enforced in code, not left as policy.** Originally considered documenting "monochrome" in the design language but leaving indigo/crimson imports in tokens.css "for Phase 8." Rejected — leaves a latent contradiction between language and tokens. Rebound `--accent-*` to `--gray-*` in the fork-and-own `tokens.css` directly.
- **Gray flavor swap via alias, not rename.** Imports changed from `gray.css` to `mauve.css`; `--gray-N: var(--mauve-N)` alias added so downstream Mini CSS (axioms.css, primitives.css) keeps referencing `--gray-N` unchanged. This is Mini's sanctioned swap pattern.

**Tradeoffs discussed:**
- **Invoke `/elicit-design-language` via the Skill tool vs. run the procedure manually.** Chose manual — the task required cross-referencing specific inferred axioms from the draft before asking cold, which the skill's stock interview doesn't do. Downside: no skill-tool telemetry firing. Compensated by adding a real `pattern-log.md` entry capturing the elicitation rationale — Mini's canonical log for this.
- **Update tokens.css now vs. defer to Phase 8.** Deferred fonts + radii initially; user review pushed toward "enforce the design language in code now rather than document aspirationally." Agreed — drift between language and tokens is the failure mode Mini is designed to prevent.
- **Chromatic accent candidates explored and rejected:** purple (Linear overlap), terracotta (Claude-brand overlap), pure red (too intense), indigo (Mini default — chose not to inherit).

**Lessons learned:**
- Mini's `install.sh` had a `-d "$DEST/.git"` check that fails in git worktrees (where `.git` is a file). Worked around with a sed-patched temp copy; the upstream fix had already landed in Mini's main branch (commit `83df0b2`) but wasn't pinned yet. Syncing bumped the pin.
- The draft's principles survived elicitation with surprisingly few amendments — two principles adjusted (motion, theme), two added to the Review Checklist (semantic-color policing, monochrome policing). Evidence that the product-level thinking was right; only the defaults needed to be made concrete.
- `elicit-design-language` skill's interview script works well for cold elicitation. For an already-primed draft, it's better to state inferences upfront and ask the user to confirm/refine — saves one round trip per axiom and produces better answers because the user is reacting to a concrete proposal.

### Project spec, compliance framing, and core docs set up
**Date:** 2026-04-20
**Branch:** initial-build
**Commit:** pending

**What was done:**
Moved the repo from a single placeholder `SPEC.md` (policy and compliance framing only) to a full product specification plus the `core-docs/` template structure. `SPEC.md` content is now integrated into `core-docs/spec.md` alongside vision, product architecture, UX model, agent model, tech stack, decisions log, and open questions. Added `CLAUDE.md` at repo root. Populated `core-docs/plan.md` with the build roadmap, `core-docs/feedback.md` with captured user direction, `core-docs/workflow.md` as the session guide, and `core-docs/design-language.md` as scaffolding for future design work.

**Why:**
The prior `SPEC.md` covered only the Anthropic compliance model — enough to avoid bad patterns, not enough to build against. A week of collaborative spec'ing produced 28 architectural and product decisions. The project needed a durable home for those decisions plus the conventional `core-docs/` shape so future agents can load context predictably.

**Design decisions:**
- Target user is a non-technical operator (designer, PM, founder, full-stack builder), not a developer. This re-frames every surface decision.
- Manager-of-agents metaphor drives nomenclature (project / workspace / tab), UX (three-pane + activity spine), and agent behavior (persistent team lead, ephemeral subagents, role identities only).
- Four-tier attention model (inline / ambient / notify / digest) — agents can surface richly in active contexts but do not unilaterally open tabs.
- Tabs are the sole working-surface primitive; panels-within-tabs rejected as unnecessary complexity.
- Templates over types for new tabs — defaults without constraints.
- Project docs live in the repo as `.md` files. Agents pick them up as codebase context.

**Technical decisions:**
- Stack: Tauri + Rust core + TS/React frontend + Swift helper for Apple Foundation Models. Tauri chosen over Electron for subprocess-under-load behavior, footprint, and security defaults.
- Event-sourced workspace state for audit, time-travel, and mobile-ready sync.
- Abstract `Orchestrator` trait with Claude Code agent teams as the first implementation. Anthropic will iterate; we keep an interface seam.
- Local models serve only the ops layer (audit, context optimizer, patterns, recaps). They never replace Claude for building.
- SQLite holds app-only state; project artifacts live as `.md` in the repo.

**Tradeoffs discussed:**
- Tauri vs Electron vs SwiftUI: chose Tauri. Electron was the faster-to-ship fallback; SwiftUI would have lost Monaco/Mermaid/markdown ecosystem. Wails considered and rejected given Rust's subprocess story matches Designer's workload better.
- Rich GUI vs terminal-like Conductor feel: rich. Compliance guidance restricts auth and proxying, not presentation.
- Agent-teams primitive adoption: adopt, but abstract. Anthropic's multi-agent primitives are experimental and will move; we do not want to be locked in.
- Mobile-from-day-one: yes, in the data layer. No mobile client in early phases.

**Lessons learned:**
- The 2026 OpenClaw ban clarified the real compliance line: OAuth token handling and subscription proxying, not UI richness. Designer is well inside the line.
- The Claude Code agent-teams documentation revealed that our intended workspace primitive maps almost exactly onto Anthropic's team primitive. This shortened the architecture significantly — we build above, not around.
- "Panels vs tabs" was a distraction. Tabs + `@` + split view is the cleaner answer.
