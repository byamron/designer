# Pattern log

> Decision rationale for non-obvious design-language or component choices. See Mini plan §13.1 for usage.

## How this differs from the design language

- `design-language.md` is the **current state**: axioms, tokens, approved patterns.
- `pattern-log.md` is the **history of decisions**: why we chose each axiom value, why we made that tradeoff, what we tried and abandoned.
- `generation-log.md` is the **mechanical record** of every skill firing (prompt, tokens used, invariants, feedback).

A minor token tweak (one value change) is logged here. An axiom change is logged in `design-language.md`'s change log AND here.

## 2026-04-21 — Initial elicitation (greenfield)

Ran `elicit-design-language` in greenfield mode. Pre-implementation (roadmap Phase 0–1), no UI code to scan. Seeded five axioms from `design-language.draft.md` (density, motion, surface-depth, focus, theme); amended two during the interview (motion now allows considered liveliness — "it's a design tool and should feel nice"; theme is now system-default instead of dark-default). Elicited six axioms fresh: base line-height 1.4 (tool register, not reading), accent identity monochrome (Notion/Linear-style — rejected purple for Linear overlap, terracotta for Claude-brand overlap, pure red for intensity), gray flavor mauve (olive and sand explicitly on the table), type Geist + Geist Mono (starting choice; may change), perfect-fourth type scale, soft-sharper radii (button=6px).

Reasoning for monochrome: Designer's primary user is a manager, not a brand; the product should feel like a cockpit, not a showcase. A chromatic accent would compete with the content (agent streams, diffs, design previews). Semantic colors stay chromatic because they're doing different work — signaling success/warning/danger/info, not decoration.

## 2026-04-21 — Accent tokens rebound to gray in tokens.css

Removed `@radix-ui/colors/indigo` and `@radix-ui/colors/crimson` imports from `packages/ui/styles/tokens.css`; rebound `--accent-1..12` and `--accent-a1..a12` to `var(--gray-N)` directly in `:root`. Removed the two `[data-accent="..."]` variant blocks. This makes the monochrome policy enforceable rather than aspirational — a consumer who writes `bg-[var(--accent-9)]` now gets gray-9, not indigo-9. If a chromatic accent is ever introduced, axiom #3 in `design-language.md` must be amended first; then the Radix import and a `[data-accent="name"]` block get re-added.

## 2026-04-21 — Gray flavor set to mauve via aliasing

Swapped the `@radix-ui/colors/gray` imports for `@radix-ui/colors/mauve`; added a `--gray-N: var(--mauve-N)` alias block in `:root` so every downstream Mini file (axioms.css, primitives.css, archetypes.css) continues to reference `--gray-N` unchanged. This is the Mini-sanctioned way to swap neutrals — the abstract `--gray-N` token name is stable; only the underlying Radix scale changes. If we want to try olive or sand later, it's a 4-line import swap + 24-line alias rewrite.
