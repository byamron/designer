# Generation log

> Append-only record of UI generation events in this project. Do not edit existing entries. See Mini plan §7.8 for schema and use.

## How to read this file

Each entry is one firing of a Mini skill that produced or modified UI code. Entries are appended in chronological order — newest at the bottom. Fields are consistent across all entries so the file is machine-readable as well as human-readable.

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Timestamp header | `## YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ — <skill-name>` |
| `prompt` | The user intent that triggered the skill. Quoted verbatim. |
| `trigger` | Which skill fired. `generate-ui` is primary; individual skill names appear when invoked directly. |
| `archetype-reused` | Archetype the generation wrapped, or `none`. |
| `components-reused` | Existing components extended or composed. `[]` if none. |
| `components-new` | New components introduced by this generation. `[]` if none. |
| `primitives` | Mini primitives used in the output. |
| `tokens` | Design-language tokens referenced by the output. |
| `invariants` | `N/M pass`. Full pass = `M/M pass`. Failures listed on indented lines. |
| `deviations` | Values or patterns that don't match the design language. `none` if clean. |
| `feedback` | `accepted` / `rejected` / `change-requested` / `pending`. User fills this in on the next turn if not already set. |

## How to use this log

- **`elicit-design-language` amendment mode** reads this file for recurring deviations. Repeated `#2a2a2a` appearances with `feedback: accepted` become a candidate new token.
- **Skill regression testing** re-runs recent prompts against modified skills. Compare invariant results and trigger fires before/after.
- **Trigger audit** (plan §13.6) uses `trigger` field + `prompt` to measure `generate-ui` hit rate on real intents.
